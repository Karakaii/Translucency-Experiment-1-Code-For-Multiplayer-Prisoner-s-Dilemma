## First Experimental Investigation of Translucency Theory: Code for Multiplayer Prisoner's dilemma

The *master* branch is the code used for the control group.
You can find it in this [release](https://github.com/Karakaii/Translucency-Experiment-1-Code-For-Multiplayer-Prisoner-s-Dilemma/releases/tag/v1.0-Control).

The *translucencyCondition* branch is the code for the latest version of the experimental group. Namely, this is the version we used for a second wave of recruitment (we were missing a few participants because of a technical issue that happened in the first wave).
The code for the first wave (which has all the conditions intended, but fewer server logs) can be found in this [release](https://github.com/Karakaii/Translucency-Experiment-1-Code-For-Multiplayer-Prisoner-s-Dilemma/releases/tag/v2.0-Translucency).
